I am going to describe a dataset that gives information about the height, weight, gender, age and Body Mass Index of various human adults in a sample population. The dataset consists of a table with 108 rows corresponding to observations for an individual adult, and seven columns corresponding to the individuals reported age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (or BMI for short), BMI label, and BMI label index, respectively. The measurements for age are given in years. The measurements for height are given in centimeters. The measurements for weight are given in kilograms. The reported genders are either "Male" or "Female". The BMI measurements are kilograms per meters squared, or kg/m2. The BMI label indices are integers ranging from 0 - 3, with each integer coding for an associated BMI label. Specifically, 0 corresponds to the BMI label "Underweight", 1 corresponds to the BMI label "Normal Weight", 2 corresponds to the BMI label "Overweight", and 3 corresponds to the BMI label "Obese".
