I am going to describe a dataset that gives information about the height, weight, gender, age and Body Mass Index of various human adults in a sample population. The dataset consists of a table with 108 rows corresponding to observations for an individual adult, and seven columns corresponding to the individuals reported age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (or BMI for short), BMI label, and BMI label index, respectively. The measurements for age are given in years. The measurements for height are given in centimeters. The measurements for weight are given in kilograms. The reported genders are either "Male" or "Female". The BMI measurements are kilograms per meters squared, or kg/m2. The BMI label indices are integers ranging from 0 - 3, with each integer coding for an associated BMI label. Specifically, 0 corresponds to the BMI label "Underweight", 1 corresponds to the BMI label "Normal Weight", 2 corresponds to the BMI label "Overweight", and 3 corresponds to the BMI label "Obese".

In the Python programming langauge, this dataset can be represented in memory as a Pandas Dataframe object. In all responses that follow please use the convention that this dataframe is assigned to a variable named "dfr" in code, and that its columns are labeled "Age", Gender", "Height", "Weight", "BMI", "BmiLabel", and "BmiLabelIndex", respecively.

Using the human language user input query given in quotations in the next paragraph, please return code for a python function which takes the dataframe described above as input, and returns either a set of computed numerical outputs, or else a visualization generated using Python's Plotly library, which provide a thorough answer to the user's input query. Please use Python's Pandas library to represent the dataframe as described above. Do not include any extraneous desciption or example usage, please only include evaluable code in your response. Only include the function defition and do not precede it with ```python designator. It is absolutely critical that the returned function have the name "response_function", so please be sure to name it this. If a visualization is requested, make sure the function returns the figure object and does not include commands to show or display the figure in the code.

The user's human language input query is as follows:
