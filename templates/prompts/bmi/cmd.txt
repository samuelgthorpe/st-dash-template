In the Python programming langauge, the previously described dataset can be represented in memory as a Pandas Dataframe object. In the response that follows please use the convention that this dataframe is assigned to a variable named "dfr" in code with appropriately labeled columns.

Using the human language user input query given in quotations in the next paragraph, please return code for a python function which takes the dataframe described above as input, and returns either a set of computed numerical outputs, or else a visualization generated using Python's Plotly library, which provide a thorough answer to the user's input query. Please use Python's Pandas library to represent the dataframe as described above. Do not include any extraneous desciption or example usage, please only include evaluable code in your response. Only include the function defition and do not precede it with ```python designator. It is absolutely critical that the returned function have the name "response_function", so please be sure to name it this. If a visualization is requested, make sure the function returns the figure object and does not include commands to show or display the figure in the code. It is also critical to include any necessary import statements in the function definition. For example, if you need to use the pandas or numpy libraries in the response_function, make sure to include the import statements "import pandas as pd" or "import numpy as np" and of course the plotly library if needed in the response_function definition itself.

The user's human language input query is as follows:
